        <div class="col-lg-6">
            <p>A <a href="/clinical-trials" class="simple-link">clinical trial</a> is a research study utilizing human volunteers to answer specific health questions. Carefully conducted clinical trials are the safest and fastest way to find treatments that work in people, and new ways to improve health.</p>
            <p>Many clinical trials are done to see if a new drug or device is safe and effective for people to use. Clinical trials are also done for other reasons. Some compare existing treatments to determine which is better. The current, approved treatments are called the “standard treatments.” Sometimes clinical trials are used to study different ways to use the standard treatments so they will be more effective, easier to use, and/or decrease side effects. Sometimes, studies are done to learn how to best use the treatment in a different population, such as children, in whom the treatment was not previously tested.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-6">
            <p>Participants in clinical trials can play a more active role in their own health care, gain access to new research treatments before they are widely available, and help others by contributing to medical research. It is no exaggeration to say that a large share of the credit for current treatment successes belongs to the people who participated in the clinical trials conducted over the last decade.</p>

                <h2 class="alt">Reasons for Research</h2>
                <p>Clinical trials are designed to advance medical science and the improve quality of life for so many people. But no part of a clinical trial is as vital to its success as participating volunteers. Without them, new medical breakthroughs simply would not occur.</p>

                <p>When you participate in a clinical trial, you are contributing to research that could bring new treatments one step closer to reaching many patients across the world. The trial may not only help advance the science for your disease or illness, but could also make progress for related areas of science.</p>

        <p>Participation in clinical trials is not without risks; however, patients are closely monitored and there are often health benefits. Patients receive education about their disease, access to a drug that might not be available because of cost or availability outside the trial, and, in many cases, see improvement because they are paying more attention to their health.</p>
